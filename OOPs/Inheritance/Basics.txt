Inheritance refers to using a predefined set of class to generate another class without rewriting the code and it helps implement one of the most
vital features of OOPs in CPP i.e reusability of code thereby enhancing the entire experience of programming 
Not only this but also Inheritance helps to implement the features like data encapsulation which means that access to certain member functions and data members can be restricted
This is done using Access Modifiers (private,Public and Protected)
Type of Inheritance:-
1.Single Inheritance:- one class gives is derived from another 
                           A--->B
2. Multilevel Inheritance:- One class is derived from a specified base class and then it gives rise to another class in the form of a chain
                          A-->B-->C
                          (A:Base class for B)
                          (B:Base class for C)
3. Multiple Inheritance:- Two Base classes give rise to a single derived class (similar to two objects merging together to give rise to one single entity)                          
                         X
                        /  \                       
                       <    >
                        Y   Z  
                        (Y and Z are Multiple base classes for X)
4. Hybrid Inheritance:- Any combination of the above discussed types of inheritances is termed as Hybrid inheritance
Eg. Single and Multiple
Multiple and Multilevel..............etc.
