Finding the duplicate elements of an array:-
Using a nested loop the outer loop selects the element of the array in the order of their increasing indices 
The inner loop scans through the successive elements of the array in order to find any copies (if they exist)
And then displays the elements accordingly
A flag variable is assigned to display the message in case all the elements are unique in nature
