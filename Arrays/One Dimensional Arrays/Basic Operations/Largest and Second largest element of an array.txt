Finding the largest and the second largest element of an array:-
The first element of an array (index=0) is assumed as the largest element and the next element with the index=1 is assumed to be the second largest element
Its compared with all the subsequent elements and in case the element is found to be larger than the ones assumed
The element is then interchanged with the corresponding element 
In order to find the second largest element an additional condition of the element being not equal to the largest element is imposed
In a similar iterative process the smallest and the second smallest elements can be found
