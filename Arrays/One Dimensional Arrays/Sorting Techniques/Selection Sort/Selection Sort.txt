Methodology of Selection Sort:- 
1.Primary loop compares all the elements of the array with the next (size-index) elements and then swaps the element with the current (ith) element
2.Process goes on until all the elements are arranged in ascending order
3.Time complexity:- O(n^2)
time complexity is extremely poor due to the trivial approach which leads to the 
sorting of the array by traversing it twice
