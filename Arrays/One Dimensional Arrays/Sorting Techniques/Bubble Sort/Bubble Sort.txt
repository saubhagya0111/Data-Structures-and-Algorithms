Methodology of Bubble Sort:- 
Repeatedly swap two elements if they are in wrong order
1.Primary loop compares all the elements of the array with the next (size-index) elements and then swaps the element with the current (ith) element
2.Process goes on until all the elements are arranged in ascending order
3.Time complexity:- O(n^2) 
This can be optimized by using a break statement whenever the swapping of the integers does not take place
Time complexity becomes O(2n) after termination of the loop
