Working of Binary Search:-
Applicable only for the sorted arrays
1.Two ends of the arrays i.e low and high are defined
2. They are initially assigned as 0 and size-1
3. The mid elelment is compared with the key element(x) 
4. If the mid is > x post that the value of high is changed t mid-1 
5. If the mid is < x post that the value of low is changed t mid+1 
6. The process goes on till the enitre array is searched through if the element is found it return the mid index 
7. Else gives out -1 
Rationale being that the entire array is arranged in ascending order and the array is sliced into subsequent halves and then searched through
time complexity:- O(log n) 
Best Case:- 1 (mid element is the key)
